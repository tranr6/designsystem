            <h2>Production</h2>
            <p>In 2021, net production averaged 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent
                per day, including Libya, compared with 331,000 barrels of oil
                equivalent per day in 2020. The year over year decrease was
                primarily the result of lower Bakken production and the sale
                of our interests in the Shenzi Field in the Gulf of Mexico in 2020
                and the South Arne Field in Denmark in 2021, which was partially
                offset by higher production from the Liza Phase 1 development
                in Guyana and more stable operations in Libya.</p>
                <p>In the Bakken, Hess’ operated rig count averaged 2.3 in 2021,
                compared with 2.6 in 2020. As West Texas Intermediate oil
                prices moved above $50 per barrel, the company added a
                second operated rig in February 2021 and a third operated
                rig in September 2021. We brought 51 new wells on production
                in 2021, compared with 111 wells in 2020. Net production from
                the Bakken averaged 156,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
                day in 2021, compared with 193,000 barrels of oil equivalent
                per day in 2020. The decrease was due to a lower average
                rig count, higher prices for natural gas liquids that increased
                the company’s earnings and cash flow but lowered production
                entitlements under the company’s percentage of proceeds
                contracts, the planned turnaround of the Tioga Gas Plant, and
                the sale of the company’s Little Knife and Murphy Creek
                nonstrategic acreage interests.</p>

            <h2>Developments</h2>
            <p>Offshore Guyana, Hess holds a 30% interest in the 6.6 million
                acre Stabroek Block. Esso Exploration and Production Guyana
                Limited, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, is operator and holds a
                45% interest. CNOOC Petroleum Guyana Limited, a wholly
                owned subsidiary of CNOOC Limited, holds the remaining
                25% interest.</p>
            <p>First oil from the Liza Phase 2 development was achieved
                in February 2022, utilizing the Liza Unity floating production,
                storage and offloading vessel with production capacity
                of approximately 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. A third
                development at the Payara Field, also with production capacity
                of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, was sanctioned in 2020 with first oil expected in 2024. Our three
                sanctioned oil developments on the block have a Brent
                breakeven oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel.</p>

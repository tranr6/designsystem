        <h1>Letter to Shareholders</h1>
            <p>In 2021, our company continued to successfully execute our
            strategy and achieve strong operational performance. We are
            proud of our employees for their commitment to keeping our
            workplace and the communities where we operate safe
            throughout the COVID-19 pandemic</p>
            <p>Our strategy has been and continues to be to deliver high
            return resource growth, a low cost of supply and industry
            leading cash flow growth. We have built a differentiated
            portfolio offering a unique value proposition – delivering
            durable cash flow growth that enables us to invest in some
            of the highest return projects in the industry and also to grow
            cash returns to our shareholders.</p>
            <p>In terms of resource growth, we have been disciplined in
            allocating capital to the best rocks for the best returns.
            Our portfolio is focused on the Bakken, the deepwater Gulf of
            Mexico, Southeast Asia and Guyana, with its multiple phases
            of low cost oil developments, and we expect all four of these
            assets to be free cash flow generative in 2022. Our 2022 capital
            and exploratory budget is $2.6 billion, of which approximately
            80% will be allocated to Guyana and the Bakken.</p>
         <p>Because of the investments we are making, we are well
            positioned to significantly lower our cost of supply. By 2026,
            our cash costs are forecast to decline approximately 25%
            compared with 2021 to $9 per barrel of oil equivalent. In
            addition, our portfolio’s breakeven oil price is expected to
            be one of the lowest in the industry by 2026, decreasing
            to $45 per barrel Brent.</p>

        <p>In terms of cash flow growth, we have an industry leading rate
            of change and durability story. Our company is positioned to
            grow our cash flow at a compound rate of 25% per year out
            to 2026 based on a Brent oil price of $65 per barrel.</p>
        <p>Our second offshore development in Guyana, Liza Phase 2,
            began producing oil in February 2022 and, at capacity, is
            expected to add more than $1 billion of net operating cash
            flow annually at $65 per barrel Brent. Following startup,
            we repaid the remaining $500 million of our term loan, and
            in March 2022, we announced a 50% increase in our
            quarterly dividend. As our portfolio becomes increasingly
            free cash flow positive in the coming years, we commit to
            return up to 75% of our adjusted free cash flow annually
            to shareholders by continuing to grow the dividend and
            accelerating share repurchases.</p>
        <p>Key to our strategy is Guyana, the largest new oil province
            discovered in the last decade, which is positioned to be
            one of the highest margin, lowest carbon intensity oil
            developments in the world according to Wood Mackenzie
            data. On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest
            and ExxonMobil is the operator, we continued our extraordinary
            string of exploration successes with five significant discoveries in
            2021 and two additional significant discoveries in January 2022.
            Our four sanctioned oil developments on the block have world
            class economics, with a Brent breakeven oil price of between
            $25 and $35 per barrel. In 2027, at least six floating
            production, storage and offloading vessels (FPSOs)
            are expected to be online on the Stabroek Block with a
            production capacity of more than 1 million gross barrels of
            oil per day, with the potential for up to 10 FPSOs to develop
            the gross discovered recoverable resources of more than
            10 billion barrels of oil equivalent.</p>

        <p>The Bakken, our largest operated asset, remains an important
            part of our portfolio with a robust inventory of high return future
            drilling locations. In 2021, with continued strength in oil prices,
            we added a second and third rig, which will enable us to
            accelerate cash flow growth, lower our unit cash costs and
            further optimize our infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Turning to our 2021 financial results, our adjusted net
            income was $677 million compared with an adjusted net loss
            of $894 million in 2020, primarily due to higher realized prices.
            Cash flow from operations, before changes in working capital,
            was $3.0 billion, compared with $1.8 billion in the prior year.
            Letter to Shareholders
            2021 ANNUAL REPORT 3
            We have tested the resilience of Hess’ portfolio under the
            supply and demand scenarios from the International Energy
            Agency (IEA). In the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario,
            which assumes all the pledges of the Paris Agreement are met,
            oil and gas will still be 40% of the global energy mix in 2040.
            In the IEA’s newest Net Zero Scenario, oil and gas will still be
            29% of the energy mix in 2040. In either scenario, oil and gas
            will be needed for decades to come. Hess’ strategic priorities –
            to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and
            sustain cash flow growth – are aligned with the energy
            transition needed to achieve the IEA’s scenarios and position
            us well for the coming decades.
            We are honored to have been recognized throughout 2021
            as an industry leader in our environmental, social and
            governance performance and disclosure. In keeping with
            our Hess Values, we are committed to diversity, equity
            and inclusion, which we believe creates value for all of our
            stakeholders, and to the safety of our workforce and the
            communities where we operate. A multidisciplinary team
            continues to update our COVID-19 prevention protocols
            based on current conditions and guidance from public health
            authorities and our medical advisors.
            COMMITMENT TO SHAREHOLDERS
            We are proud of our company’s 2021 performance and
            grateful for the counsel of our Directors and the dedication
            of our employees. Thank you, our shareholders, for your
            continued support and interest in our company.
            Proved reserves at the end of 2021 stood at 1.31 billion barrels
            of oil equivalent, up from 1.17 billion barrels of oil equivalent at
            the end of 2020. Net proved reserve additions in 2021 totaled
            348 million barrels of oil equivalent, including positive net
            price revisions of 107 million barrels of oil equivalent, resulting
            in an overall 2021 production replacement ratio of 295% at
            a finding and development cost of approximately $5.25 per</p>
    <h2>Sustainability</h2>
            <p>As we continue to execute our strategy, our company will
                be guided by our longstanding commitment to sustainability.
                Our strategy aligns with the world’s growing need for
                affordable, reliable and cleaner energy that is necessary
                for human prosperity and global economic development.
                We recognize that climate change is the greatest scientific
                challenge of the 21st century and support the aim of the
                Paris Agreement and a global ambition to achieve net zero
                emissions by 2050. Our business planning includes actions
                we will undertake to continue reducing our carbon footprint.</p>
            <p>Our Board of Directors is climate change literate and actively
                engaged in overseeing Hess’ sustainability practices. We are
                committed to transparency – our strategy and reporting are
                closely aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force
                on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.</p>
            <p>Our Board and senior leadership have set aggressive targets
                for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. After our
                company significantly outperformed our five year emissions
                reduction targets for 2020, we announced new five year GHG
                reduction targets for 2025, which are to reduce operated
                Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity and methane
                emissions intensity by approximately 50% from 2017 and
                to eliminate routine flaring from our operations by the end of
                2025. In addition, we are contributing to groundbreaking work
                by the Salk Institute to develop plants with larger root systems
                that are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions
                of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>We have tested the resilience of Hess’ portfolio under the
                supply and demand scenarios from the International Energy
                Agency (IEA). In the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario,

        <h1>Sustainability</h1>
        <p>Our company’s purpose is to be the world’s most trusted
            energy partner. This year we will publish our 25th annual
            sustainability report, demonstrating our longstanding
            commitment to sustainability and the value we believe it
            creates for all of our stakeholders.</p>
        <p>Sustainability starts at the top of our company and is
            reinforced at every level. Our Board of Directors is climate
            change literate and actively engaged in overseeing Hess’
            environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS
            & SR) practices, working alongside senior management.</p>

                <h2>Environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure</h2>
                <p>We see transparency in reporting as an important part
                    of being a trusted energy partner. Our reporting aligns
                    with a number of frameworks, including oil and gas industry
                    metrics from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board
                    and TCFD recommendations. Our sustainability report is
                    prepared in accordance with the Core option of the Global
                    Reporting Initiative Standards. Details of our EHS & SR
                    strategy and performance, including how our plans and
                    actions support the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals,
                    are discussed in our sustainability report, available at

                <h2>Environment and Climate Change</h2>
                <p>Climate change is one of the greatest scientific challenges of
                    the 21st century. We believe climate risks can and should be
                    addressed while at the same time meeting the growing
                    demand for safe, affordable and reliable energy, which is
                    necessary to ensure a just and secure energy transition in the
                    context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
                    Governments, businesses and civil society must work together
                    on cost effective policies to meet this dual challenge, and we
                    support transparent carbon pricing as an economically
                    efficient method for managing carbon emissions.</p>

                <h2>Safety and Health</h2>
                <p>Hess’ safety programs and practices aim to maintain a
                    culture in which employees and contractors keep each other
                    safe on the job and work together to continuously improve
                    our performance. In 2021, our multidisciplinary emergency
                    response team continued to oversee our pandemic response,
                    which was highly effective in reducing the risks of COVID-19
                    in our workplace and ensuring business continuity</p>

                <h2>Social Responsibility</h2>
                <p>As part of our company’s commitment to social responsibility
                    we participate in multistakeholder initiatives designed to advance
                    transparency, environmental protection, human rights and
                    good governance. For example, we are a member of IPIECA,
                    Production Operations North Dakota
                    we contributed to its food aid program for families in need and
                    to the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Program, which
                    places recent graduates from U.S. universities into public
                    secondary schools in the Kelantan region to teach English.
                    In 2021, Hess also provided support for disaster relief and
                    pandemic response.</p>
